# fcc-simon-game
It's old school Simon Says.

## Project Overview
I started creating this Simon game for FreeCodeCamp.  It's the last project in the Front End
Certification section.

While building the previous project, Tic-Tac-Toe, I came across many issues coming from
the fact that it's been a while since I wrote the C++ version of Tic-Tac-Toe and my OOP
skills in Javascript were showing some serious cracks.

During my daily reading of all things under the sun, I was reminded of TDD (test driven
development).  I tried to implement the Jasmine framework for that game and failed.

So this represents my first _real_ forray into TDD.  Using a combination of [Bradley Braithwaite's](http://www.bradoncode.com/tutorials/angularjs-unit-testing/){:target="_blank"} and
[ng-newsletter](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/building-2048-in-angularjs.html){:target="_blank"}
tutorials I'm going to build this Simon game in AngularJS from a "test first", "code later"
approach to force me back into thinking and planning ahead of time instead of just
barreling through these, so far, fairly simple apps.

Plus, it's the same testing library they're using in MEAN.js, which I need to figure out
before I move back over to using that in the future.
